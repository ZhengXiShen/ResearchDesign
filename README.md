## Statement of Purpose
While the benefits of recycling are commonplace knowledge in the United States, many individuals are uncertain regarding the process of recycling. This process can be generally separated into three parts - collecting, manufacturing, and purchasing. With the large variety of recycled products, including aluminum cans, paper towels, and even cereal boxes, many individuals purchase recyclable products without notice.   

The topic of recycling has grown popular in recent years due to more waste being generated than ever before. In 1960, Americans generated 2.68 pounds of trash per day; by 2017, this quantity had grown to an average of 4.51 poundsand continues to grow (Cho, 2022). This waste is eventually incinerated, deposited in landfills, or washed into the ocean. This undoubtedly causes significant environmental pollution, and while incineration is sometimes used to produce energy, waste-to-energy plants have been associated with toxic emissions. Furthermore, those who are ill-informed about the recycling process dispose of their waste into recycling bins, preventing large batches of material from being recycled. Others take the lackadaisical route by disposing of their recyclables into waste bins. In a word, the recycling process will not function properly with only a portion of people committing to the cause; it will require an environment-saving movement that will demand the education and involvement of the entire society.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses
The current state of recycling in New York City leads us to propose the following question: “Relative to taking no action, does informing individuals about the benefits of recycling and the recycling process (through the form of a tutorial) lead to an increased number of items recycled?” In this case, the control group would be those who are not informed, and the treatment group would be those who are informed. We would identify the average number of items being recycled per person before and after being informed and would calculate the difference (d) between the two in both the control group and treatment groups. The null and alternative hypothesis in this case would be:

H0: dControl = dTreatment  

HA : dControl ≠ dTreatment

The null hypothesis means that the average number of items in the treatment group will be equal to the control group. In other words, informing people about the benefits to the earth's environment will not alter their passion for recycling and will not increase or decrease the number of items being recycled per person. The alternative hypothesis would be that the average difference in the treatment will not be equal to the control group. In other words, informing people about the benefits to the earth's environment will increase their passion and lead to an increase in the number of items being recycled per person proportion of recycling. The higher the treatment of the treatment group, the better we reject the null hypothesis and the more confidence we have in the alternative hypotheses. This metric is measured by the average number of items being recycled. We calculate the mean value of items being recycled for each group. In mathematical terms, we set X numerical variable = n(the value of item number), X1 as the value of #items being recycled by participant 1, X2 as being recycled by participant.
2.	mean(X1+X2…Xn)/(mean value for # items being recycled per person in control group) = μControl. Set X’ as binary variable = 1 or 0, X1’ as the value of Participant 1 choice, X2’ as the value of Participant 2 choice and so on. (X1’+X2’…Xn’)/(mean value for #items being recycled per person in treatment group) = μTreatment.
We also propose a second question: “Relative to providing tutorials to inform individuals on the benefits of recycling and the recycling process, receiving monetary payment based on the



quantity and quality of the items that are recycled result in a greater number of items being recycled?” In this case, the treatment group would be the group of people who are being paid to recycle, and the control group would be the people who are educated by giving tutorials to show them the recycling process. The average number of recycled items produced by the control group is nC, and the number of recycling items after receiving monetary payment is nT. The null and alternative hypotheses are the following:

H0: nT-nC < 0  

HA: nT-nC  >= 0

The null hypothesis states that receiving monetary payments will not work better than educating people through tutorials. The alternative hypothesis states that individuals will be more likely to recycle items if receive a monetary payment.
